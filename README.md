# Product Reviews App Builder

Adobe App Builder app for managing product reviews in Adobe Commerce Admin. Provides a React Spectrum UI and serverless actions for CRUD, search, and moderation workflows backed by App Builder DB.

## Features
- Create, update, delete, and list reviews
- Status moderation (pending/approved/rejected)
- Search and filter across review fields
- Admin UI SDK menu entry for Commerce Admin

## Tech Stack
- Adobe App Builder (Runtime actions + static UI)
- React + React Spectrum UI
- `@adobe/aio-lib-db` via `StorageRepository`
- Admin UI SDK (`@adobe/uix-guest`)

## Project Structure
- `actions/`: Runtime actions (create, update, delete, list)
- `web-src/`: React UI
- `ext.config.yaml`: Extension and action registration
- `extension-manifest.json`: Admin UI SDK extension metadata

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
aio app run
```

UI runs at `https://localhost:9080` and actions run in the selected workspace.

## Run Actions Locally
```bash
```

## Tests
```bash
npm test
npm run e2e
```

## Deploy
```bash
aio app use
aio app deploy
```

## Notes
- `.env` is generated by `aio app use` and should not be committed.
- Admin UI SDK menu registration is handled by `actions/registration/index.js`.
- IMS tokens are required for authenticated actions.
- UI log level is controlled via `window.APP_CONFIG.LOG_LEVEL` in `web-src/index.html` (e.g. `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
